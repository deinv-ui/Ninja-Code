Through the tutorials from Brian Design at Youtube, I have gained valuable hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of React.js, which has enabled me to build my own website from scratch. This practical approach to learning has been immensely beneficial in my coding journey, as it allows me to apply the concepts I've learned in real-world projects.

After doing my research, I realized that most online coding websites are cool, but they've got some downsides. One big issue is the lack of personal feedback and mentorship. You're left hanging without anyone to guide you in real-time, and that can be frustrating. The other one is that not having a clear route map on what should he/she learn next.

Another problem is the overwhelming choice of programming languages. It's like being stuck in a maze, not knowing where to start. Some folks don't even know how computers and the internet work, and that makes it even trickier.

So, I've got this awesome idea for a module! It'll bring in mentors who can chat with you live, review your code, and give you that one-on-one help. No more feeling lost and stuck!

Plus, the module will help beginners pick the right programming language based on their interests and goals. No more scratching your head and going back and forth. And hey, for those who need to understand the basics, we'll have courses that cover the internet and computer fundamentals. Let's get everyone on the same page!

With these changes, our coding learning system will be super learner-friendly, and everyone can level up their coding skills with confidence. Let's do this! ðŸš€
